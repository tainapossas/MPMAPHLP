# MPMAPHLP
Multiple Path Multiple Assignment p-Hub Location Problem (MPMAPHLP) under a competitive scenario. 

The repository contains CAB Instances â€“ 27 test instances with n ranging from 10 to 70 nodes.

For each n, there are three configurations with different numbers of hubs p.

These are the instances used in the evaluation and comparison of computational performance in competitive hub-and-spoke network design.
